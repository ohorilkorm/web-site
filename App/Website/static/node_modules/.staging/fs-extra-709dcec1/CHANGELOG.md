3.0.1 / 2017-05-04
------------------

- Fix bug in `move()` & `moveSync()` when source and destination are the same, and source does not exist. [#415](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/415)

3.0.0 / 2017-04-27
------------------

### Added

- **BREAKING:** Added Promise support. All asynchronous native fs methods and fs-extra methods now return a promise if the callback is not passed. [#403](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/403)
- `pathExists()`, a replacement for the deprecated `fs.exists`. `pathExists` has a normal error-first callback signature. Also added `pathExistsSync`, an alias to `fs.existsSync`, for completeness. [#406](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/406)

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** Removed support for setting the default spaces for `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()`. This was undocumented. [#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)

### Changed

- Upgraded jsonfile dependency to v3.0.0:
  - **BREAKING:** Changed behavior of `throws` option for `readJsonSync()`; now does not throw filesystem errors when `throws` is `false`.
- **BREAKING:** `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()` now output minified JSON by default for consistency with `JSON.stringify()`; set the `spaces` option to `2` to override this new behavior. [#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)
- Use `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` instead of `new Buffer()` in environments that support it. [#394](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/394)

### Fixed

- `removeSync()` silently failed on Windows in some cases. Now throws an `EBUSY` error. [#408](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/408)

2.1.2 / 2017-03-16
------------------

### Fixed

- Weird windows bug that resulted in `ensureDir()`'s callback being called twice in some cases. This bug may have also affected `remove()`. See [#392](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/392), [#393](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/393)

2.1.1 / 2017-03-15
------------------

### Fixed

- Reverted [`5597bd`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/5597bd5b67f7d060f5f5bf26e9635be48330f5d7), this broke compatibility with Node.js versions v4+ but less than `v4.5.0`.
- Remove `Buffer.alloc()` usage in `moveSync()`.

2.1.0 / 2017-03-15
------------------

Thanks to [Mani Maghsoudlou (@manidlou)](https://github.com/manidlou) & [Jan Peer St√∂cklmair (@JPeer264)](https://github.com/JPeer264) for their extraordinary help with this release!

### Added
- `moveSync()` See [#309], [#381](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/381). ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))
- `copy()` and `copySync()`'s `filter` option now gets the destination path passed as the second parameter. [#366](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/366) ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))

### Changed
- Use `Buffer.alloc()` instead of deprecated `new Buffer()` in `copySync()`. [#380](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/380) ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))
- Refactored entire codebase to use ES6 features supported by Node.js v4+ [#355](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/355). [(@JPeer264)](https://github.com/JPeer264)
- Refactored docs. ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))

### Fixed

- `move()` shouldn't error out when source and dest are the same. [#377](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/377), [#378](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/378) ([@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton))

2.0.0 / 2017-01-16
------------------

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Removed support for Node `v0.12`. The Node foundation stopped officially supporting it
on Jan 1st, 2017.
- **BREAKING:** Remove `walk()` and `walkSync()`. `walkSync()` was only part of `fs-extra` for a little
over two months. Use [klaw](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw) instead of `walk()`, in fact, `walk()` was just
an alias to klaw. For `walkSync()` use [klaw-sync](https://github.com/mawni/node-klaw-sync). See: [#338], [#339]

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Renamed `clobber` to `overwrite`. This affects `copy()`, `copySync()`, and `move()`. [#330], [#333]
- Moved docs, to `docs/`. [#340]

### Fixed
- Apply filters to directories in `copySync()` like in `copy()`. [#324]
- A specific condition when disk is under heavy use, `copy()` can fail. [#326]


1.0.0 / 2016-11-01
------------------

After five years of development, we finally have reach the 1.0.0 milestone! Big thanks goes
to [Ryan Zim](https://github.com/RyanZim) for leading the charge on this release!

### Added
- `walkSync()`

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: dropped Node v0.10 support.
- disabled `rimaf` globbing, wasn't used. [#280]
- deprecate `copy()/copySync()` option `filter` if it's a `RegExp`. `filter` should now be a function.
- inline `rimraf`. This is temporary and was done because `rimraf` depended upon the beefy `glob` which `fs-extra` does not use. [#300]

### Fixed
- bug fix proper closing of file handle on `utimesMillis()` [#271]
- proper escaping of files with dollar signs [#291]
- `copySync()` failed if user didn't own file. [#199], [#301]


0.30.0 / 2016-04-28
-------------------
- Brought back Node v0.10 support. I didn't realize there was still demand. Official support will end **2016-10-01**.

0.29.0 / 2016-04-27
-------------------
- **BREAKING**: removed support for Node v0.10. If you still want to use Node v0.10, everything should work except for `ensureLink()/ensureSymlink()`. Node v0.12 is still supported but will be dropped in the near future as well.

0.28.0 / 2016-04-17
-------------------
- **BREAKING**: removed `createOutputStream()`. Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-output-stream. See: [#192][#192]
- `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` check for invalid win32 path chars. See: [#209][#209], [#237][#237]
- `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` if drive not mounted, error. See: [#93][#93]

0.27.0 / 2016-04-15
-------------------
- add `dereference` option to `copySync()`. [#235][#235]

0.26.7 / 2016-03-16
-------------------
- fixed `copy()` if source and dest are the same. [#230][#230]

0.26.6 / 2016-03-15
-------------------
- fixed if `emptyDir()` does not have a callback: [#229][#229]

0.26.5 / 2016-01-27
-------------------
- `copy()` with two arguments (w/o callback) was broken. See: [#215][#215]

0.26.4 / 2016-01-05
-------------------
- `copySync()` made `preserveTimestamps` default consistent with `copy()` which is `false`. See: [#208][#208]

0.26.3 / 2015-12-17
-------------------
- fixed `copy()` hangup in copying blochub.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/337    "copy doesn't return a yieldable value"
